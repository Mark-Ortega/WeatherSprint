# WeatherSprint

Progress Log-
Day One:
I spent most of the day creating the design of the website more or less, didn't have enough time to start fetching the API's. Im going to be working on it after hours to atleast get my API's so i don't have to play catchup tomorrow.

Day Two: Spent most of my morning doing so last minute studying for evaluations, did the evaluation. Then took a 10 minute break, after that break i started working on the Java Script portion and manage to get the Geolocation prompt working, now i need to fetch the API's and do the scrollable favorites list next. Oh and i also started the async function I have to complete that. Will definitely be working on it for homework tonight. Hopefully complete the async function, the scrollable list of favorites/css touchups and start fetching some data.

Day Three: Did not make as much progress as i would've liked, i messed with the css and html because i forgot to do my api key, i succesfully got it and started trying to fetch data but was confused, doesn't help that im working from home either. I will continue working on this and doing some research/watching lms videos to try to see what im doing wrong as i have been since after lunch(when my api key was valid). kinda sucks that i waited this long but i practically wasted yesterday. Hopefully i can fetch these api's by tonight so i can start working on search bar and the time API tomorrow. As for css and html i kinda fixed some erros in my prototype and made it closer to the figma. Im currently in the process of fixing sizes and centering a button. I've also been working/testing different scrollable lists for my favorite list. Almost done with that. I also need to make the "Save to favorites" button functional.

Day Four: I definitely got stuck on trying to display my data and now have to play a major catchup game. Im struggling with actually displaying it and have tried multiple methods but i guess thats what ill be working on most of tonight. I still need to get the search bar working which should be pretty simple, and 5 day forecast but i might start that tonight and try to finish by tomorrow, really the main part im struggling with is actually displaying the data.

Day 5:
