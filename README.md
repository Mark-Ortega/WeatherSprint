# WeatherSprint

Progress Log-
Day One:
I spent most of the day creating the design of the website more or less, didn't have enough time to start fetching the API's. Im going to be working on it after hours to atleast get my API's so i don't have to play catchup tomorrow.

Day Two: Spent most of my morning doing so last minute studying for evaluations, did the evaluation. Then took a 10 minute break, after that break i started working on the Java Script portion and manage to get the Geolocation prompt working, now i need to fetch the API's and do the scrollable favorites list next. Oh and i also started the async function I have to complete that. Will definitely be working on it for homework tonight. Hopefully complete the async function, the scrollable list of favorites/css touchups and start fetching some data.
